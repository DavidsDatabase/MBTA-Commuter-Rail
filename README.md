# MBTA Commuter Rail Analysis

### Project Overview

This project's objective is to provide insights on passenger boardings per different lines on the MBTA Commuter Rail throughout the years. By analyzing some KPIs from the dataset, we look to identify any trends, make data-driven recommendations, and hopefully gauge on the company's performance.

### About the Data

The primary dataset can be found on <https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/MassDOT::mbta-commuter-rail-ridership-by-service-date-and-line/about>. This dataset provided data for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. It was mentioned some monthly data was missing/not documented.

### Tools Used

- Python - Data Cleaning & Data Analysis 
- Tableau - Data Visualization

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

1. Data Cleaning and Sorting
2. Data Formatting and Transforming

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed to answer key questions, such as, but not limited to:

1. Which line had the most boardings?
2. Comparing total boardings per year
3. Comparing total boardings between the months in 2023, increase/decrease?
4. Comparing total estimated boardings per month for all 4 years, any notable changes between the years.
5. Comparing Percent Increase/Decrease between months per year


### Results/Findings

1. Providence/Stoughton reported to had the most boardings, 10,894,972, significantly higher than most other lines on the commuter rail. This could be that the MBTA does not reach this stop via their other services. Many customers may be looking to use the commuter rail to travel to and from Boston or anywhere near the area.
2. There was an exponential growth in riders from years 2020 to 2023. Even though half the data from 2020 were not factored in, we found that the growth was exponentially significant. A reason for this could be from Covid. 2020 was a year that riders seemed to be comfortable taking public transportation as opposed to the previous year 2019. As the years went on, more and more returning riders came back to the commuter rail.
3. The number of riders from each month were spread evenly throughout the year of 2023. However, it appears that January and Febuary were the only 2 months that fell a bit short compared to the others. This could be weather related. Winter season could infer that less customers were willing to travel. Commuter rail could face delay issues due to the weather.
4. Ridership percentage increased significantly from 2020 to 2021, again, probably due to post Covid season which enticed returning customers to board the commuter rail. From 2021 to 2022, the growth is still pretty significant; however, between the years of 2022 to 2023, the growth is starting to become stagnant as the number of boarders begin to plateau. 

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:

- Perhaps creating new stops along the commuter rail to attract more customers from different areas.
- Increase service uptime or quality to maintain current riders.
- Look to reduce cost or travel time to maintain current riders.
